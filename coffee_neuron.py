# First, we'll define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential()

# Add a hidden layer with 64 units and ReLU activation
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)))

# Add a second hidden layer with 32 units and ReLU activation
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'))

# Add an output layer with 4 units and linear activation
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(4, activation='linear'))

# Next, we'll compile the model with a mean squared error loss function
# and an Adam optimizer
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')

# Now, we'll define some training data and labels
# For simplicity, let's assume the perfect coffee recipe has the following
# values for the inputs:
# Total dissolved solids: 1
# Extraction yield: 0.9
# Coffee mass: 20
# Water mass: 200
# Time of brewing: 240
perfect_recipe = np.array([[1, 0.9, 20, 200, 240]])
labels = np.array([[1, 0.9, 20, 200]])

# Now, we can train the model on the training data
model.fit(perfect_recipe, labels, epochs=10)

# Now that the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions
# Let's say we have the following inputs:
# Total dissolved solids: 1.1
# Extraction yield: 0.95
# Coffee mass: 25
# Water mass: 250
# Time of brewing: 300
new_recipe = np.array([[1.1, 0.95, 25, 250, 300]])
predictions = model.predict(new_recipe)

# The model's predictions will be a 4-element array, with the predicted
# values for total dissolved solids, extraction yield, coffee mass, and water mass
print(predictions)
